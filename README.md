## Overview / Purpose

The purpose of this lab is to introduce the student to an RTOS.   FreeRTOS is automatically configured within this IDE, and used here to do various concurrent tasks.  

All of the lab will start from a pre-built STM32 'Project.'  If you're reading this, you've probably already accepted and cloned the project into your STM32CubeIDE workspace.  If you need help do that, see the instructions [HERE](./Documentation/Working_with_Labs_from_Github_Classroom_Repository.pdf).

Open and follow the instructions found in the WORD document in your cloned repo: 

> ./Documentation/Assignment.md

Modify the document with answers when finished, then commit your repository to github. The commit will upload this document as well and serves as the lab submission. You can edit the assignment file with a simple text editor, a WYSIWYG editor such as MarkText, or a development IDE with MarkDown previewing tools such as VSCode.

The final part of the assignment is to paste the URL of this repo into the iLearn Assignment.
